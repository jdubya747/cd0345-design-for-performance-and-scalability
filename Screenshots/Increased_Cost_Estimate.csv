,"Goal was to increase availablity and reliabibility. We previous planned EC2 instances in two AZ's which in could times enables scaling. However, if we loast an AZ, the site would be overwhelmed and would come to its knees. Additionally, an AZ failure with hardware failure in the other zone would be site down. We know have reserved instance webservers in each AZ. 2 reserved instance app server in each AZ. In addition we have an ondemand web and app server in each AZ. We also added and additional RDS read instance for reliability and throughput",,,,,,,
